# CS 3500 Calendar

1. Refactored controller substantively to be taking input
from buttons rather than user input, and made it into an
action listener.
2. Added calendars retriever method in model for easier
coding of calendar dropdown in GUI controller.
3. Made series protected in CalEventImpl class so that it
could fix a bug with ZonedCalEventImpl instances.
