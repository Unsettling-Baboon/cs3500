# CS 3500 Homework 3: Calculator Part 2

## Submission instructions

Make sure that your entire solution is contained in the directory `src/main/java/calculator`. All of your tests should
be contained in a single test class, `src/test/java/CalculatorTest.java`. Each time that you make a `git push` into this
repository, Pawtograder will automatically run the autograder script on your code. You'll find the results in
Pawtograder, with a link to the results in the `Actions` tab.

> [!WARNING]
> The late policy for this class allows you to submit any assignment up to 24 hours late, **but** you must *request* the
> extension in Pawtograder *before* the deadline.
